            <ul>
                <li><b>Scope: </b> Variables declared with var keyword are only accessible in the function they are declared</li>
                <li><b>Hoisting: </b> Variables declared with var keyword can be used before the real declaration, but it's value will be undefined till the real declaration</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>let</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Scope: </b> Variables declared with let keyword are accessible in the block they are declared, it can be anything defined with curly braces</li>
                <li><b>Hoisting: </b> Variables declared with let keyword cannot be used before their real declaration</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>const</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Scope: </b> Variables declared with const keywords are also block scoped</li>
                <li><b>Immutability: </b> Once a const variable is declared it can never be reassigned</li>

        <h1>Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h1>
        <h4>null</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>null keyword shows the initial absence of value. It is something that is used when we want to keep something as empty</li>
            <li>null keyword can be returned by a function to indicated they didn't find the desired result</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>undefined</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>when a variable is declared but not assigned, javascript puts undefined as its value automatically</li>
            <li>if a function doesnt return any value it returns undefined</li>
            <li>when you try to access a property of any element that does not exist you get undefined</li>
