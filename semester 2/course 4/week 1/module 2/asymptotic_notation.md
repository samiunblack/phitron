# Popular Big-O Notations

Big-O notation is commonly used to describe the upper bound or the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm. Here are some popular Big-O notations:

1. O(1): Constant time complexity. It means that the algorithm's running time does not depend on the size of the input. It's like performing a simple operation that takes the same amount of time, no matter how big the problem is.

2. O(log n): Logarithmic time complexity. It means the running time grows slowly as the size of the input increases. An example of this is binary search, which efficiently finds elements in a sorted list.

3. O(n): Linear time complexity. It means the running time increases linearly with the size of the input. If the input size doubles, the running time also doubles. For example, iterating through an array to find a specific element is usually O(n).

4. O(n log n): Linearithmic time complexity. It's a bit faster than O(n^2) but slower than O(n). Many efficient sorting algorithms, like merge sort and quicksort, have this time complexity.

5. O(n^2): Quadratic time complexity. It means the running time grows quadratically with the size of the input. For example, nested loops that iterate over an array often result in O(n^2) complexity.

6. O(n^3): Cubic time complexity. It means the running time grows cubically with the size of the input. Algorithms with three nested loops are often of this complexity.

7. O(2^n): Exponential time complexity. It means the running time grows exponentially with the size of the input. This complexity is usually found in algorithms that involve generating all possible subsets or permutations.

8. O(n!): Factorial time complexity. It's the worst-case scenario, where the running time grows factorially with the size of the input. This complexity is very inefficient and typically occurs in brute-force algorithms that generate all possible permutations.

These are some of the most common Big-O notations used to describe the performance of algorithms. It's important to choose algorithms with lower time complexities whenever possible to ensure efficient problem-solving, especially for large input sizes.
